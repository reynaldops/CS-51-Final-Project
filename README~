CS 51 Final Project: Part of Speech Tagger
Contributors: Billy Janitsch, Jenny Liu, Yuechen Zhao, Joy Zheng

----- COMPILATIONS AND RUNTIME INSTRUCTIONS -----
To build code, go into highest level in repository and run:
javac -classpath . *.java

To execute with the GUI, run:
java POSTaggerApp
(NOTE: The tagger only tags complete, i.e. period-terminated, sentences. 
Trailing words will not be tagged.)

To test accuracy using the current datafile, tagset, and simplified tagset
in the folder, run:
java POSTaggerApp test <directoryname>

To view parts of speech without the GUI, run:
java POSTaggerApp view <and then some text here that you want to see tagged.>
(NOTE: the text to be tagged must be period-terminated.)

To create a datafile from the command line, run:
java POSTaggerApp compute <tagset location> <simple tagset location> <corpus directory> <datafile save location>

----- DEBUGGING -----
In particular, the corpus directory may NOT contain any non-corpus files, which will causes errors upon running.

For Mac OS users, the Mac finder has the tendency to create a file called ".DS_Store" in the corpus
directory, which has caused problems. If this is the case, remove the file manually and try again.

----- DEFAULT FILE NAMES -----
datafile.txt : The file of compiled probabilities


/corpus : a directory containing the Brown Corpus
