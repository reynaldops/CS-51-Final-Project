javac -classpath . *.java

To execute with the GUI, run:

(NOTE: The tagger only tags complete, i.e. period-terminated, sentences. 
Trailing words will not be tagged.)

To test accuracy using the current corpus, dtatfile, tagset, and simplified tagset
in the folder, run:
java POSTaggerApp test

To view parts of speech without the GUI, run:
java POSTaggerApp view and then some text here that you want to see tagged.
(NOTE: the text to be tagged must be period-terminated.)
